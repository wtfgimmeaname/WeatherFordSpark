### WeatherFordSpark

This is my MockStartup. WeatherSpark is by far one of my favorite
web services out there right now. This is my *minimal clone* for
running a simple city search and displaying a google map of the area
and harnessing the weather library to show temperatures and cloud layers.

Todo:
- Show current cookie.
- Add reset button
- Toggle for cloud layer.
- Add graph of temperature data.
- Show HUD for searched location.
